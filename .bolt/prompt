Here's a prompt to guide the development of a simplified MVP for the NGO Volunteer & Operations Management App using React Native, without database integration. Authentication will be handled locally by storing credentials in a JSON file, keeping it lightweight and suitable for initial prototyping.

### MVP Development Prompt for NGO Volunteer & Operations Management App (No Database)

Build a React Native-based MVP for an NGO app targeting volunteers, admins, and parents, using Expo for cross-platform support (iOS and Android). Avoid database connections and implement authentication by storing credentials in a local JSON file. The UI should reflect the pastel gradient theme (light purple to peach), rounded cards, and a "Akshar" logo placeholder from the provided screenshots. Focus on the following core features:

1. **User Authentication**
   - Implement a simple email/password login and signup system using a local JSON file (e.g., `credentials.json`) to store user data.
   - Include role-based access (Volunteer, Admin, Parent) selected during signup, stored in the JSON file.
   - Design a login screen with a "Welcome Back!" header, email/password fields, and a black "Login" button, styled as per the screenshot.
   - Use a hardcoded initial dataset in the JSON file (e.g., a few mock users) and allow new users to be appended.

2. **Volunteer Communication**
   - Create a basic chat interface using `react-native-gifted-chat`, with messages stored locally in the app's state (not synced).
   - Style chat bubbles with pastel pink for sent messages and light purple for received messages, matching the "Nagesh Sir" conversation layout.
   - Limit to a single group chat for now, with mock data loaded initially.

3. **Class Scheduling**
   - Develop a calendar view using `react-native-calendars`, displaying events with a clean grid layout as shown.
   - Enable admins to add events (date, time, title, teacher name) via a form, stored in the app's local state (e.g., an array).
   - Display upcoming shifts in a card list (e.g., "Archisha Yadav, English Teacher, 12:00 pm") using mock data.

4. **Parent Notifications**
   - Add an admin-only screen to send bulk text messages to parents, using a mock console.log output (no API integration yet).
   - Store parent contact info in the app's local state with consent flags, initialized with mock data.

5. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Build a dashboard for admins with a list of upcoming shifts and a pie chart using `react-native-chart-kit` showing volunteer hours (e.g., 70 hrs volunteered, 50 hrs remaining), using static mock data.
   - Include a "Team Updates" section with a "View" button, styled as a pastel card.

6. **General Features**
   - Use Expo Offline for local data persistence, saving the JSON file and state to the device.
   - Add mock push notifications using Expo Notifications (test with static alerts).
   - Apply a consistent UI theme: pastel gradients, rounded corners, and a logo placeholder at the top.

#### Technical Guidelines
- Use Expo Go for initial development and testing.
- Structure the project with modular screens (Login, Chat, Schedule, Admin) and reusable components (e.g., EventCard, ChatBubble).
- Use `AsyncStorage` to read/write the `credentials.json` file and manage local state.
- Use `styled-components` or inline styles to replicate the gradient background and pastel color scheme.
- Start with a single-stack navigation using `@react-navigation/native`.

#### Deliverables
- A working React Native app with the above features, testable via Expo Go.
- A `credentials.json` file with initial mock user data and instructions in a README for adding new users.
- Mock data for chat, schedules, and dashboard elements, stored locally.

#### Timeline & Scope
- Target 1-2 weeks for MVP completion by a small team.
- Prioritize core flows: login → schedule view → chat → admin dashboard.
- Test on at least one device/emulator per platform.

Start by setting up the project with `expo init`, installing dependencies (e.g., `@react-navigation/native`, `react-native-gifted-chat`, `react-native-calendars`, `react-native-chart-kit`), and creating a `credentials.json` file. Begin with the login screen, implementing local authentication, and iterate through each feature.
